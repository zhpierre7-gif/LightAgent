## Memory Security Guidance

LightAgent accepts external memory backends through a small `store()` and
`retrieve()` interface. This keeps the framework flexible, but it also means
deployments must treat long-term memory as a trust boundary.

### Threat Model

Shared memory backends can persist user supplied content and later return it as
agent context. If untrusted content is written into the same memory namespace as
trusted content, a later request can retrieve poisoned facts and pass them to the
model as apparently reliable context.

This is especially important for high-impact domains such as healthcare,
finance, legal, enterprise automation, and policy support.

### Recommended Defaults

- Use separate memory namespaces per user, tenant, agent, and environment.
- Do not share graph memory across users unless there is an explicit product
  requirement and a reviewable access policy.
- Treat retrieved memories as untrusted context unless the memory backend can
  provide provenance and trust metadata.
- Disable memory writes for high-impact workflows until source trust,
  consistency checks, and rollback behavior are defined.
- Log memory writes at the metadata level: user id, agent id, source, timestamp,
  and trust level. Avoid logging sensitive raw content unless required by your
  compliance process.

### Admission Checks Before Writing Memory

Memory adapters should validate candidate memories before persistence:

- Record provenance: source user, agent, tool, channel, and timestamp.
- Keep trust levels separate, for example system, admin, verified source,
  authenticated user, and unauthenticated user.
- Reject or quarantine memories that contradict higher-trust facts.
- Avoid merging entities only by similar names; include entity type, context,
  tenant, and relation neighborhood in entity resolution.
- Preserve conflicting facts with provenance instead of silently deleting older
  trusted facts.

### Retrieval Checks Before Using Memory

Before injecting retrieved memory into the model context:

- Filter by tenant, user, agent, and allowed source trust level.
- Prefer verified or same-user memories over cross-user memories.
- Include provenance in internal context where possible.
- For high-impact answers, require a trusted external source or tool result
  before producing recommendations.

### Mem0 Graph Memory Notes

When using Mem0 graph memory or another shared graph backend, configure it so
one user's conversational claims cannot overwrite or remove trusted facts for
another user. If the backend cannot enforce that policy, use isolated memory
instances or per-user namespaces.

### LightAgent Adapter Guidance

Custom memory implementations passed to `LightAgent(memory=...)` should enforce
the security policy inside their `store()` and `retrieve()` methods. LightAgent
will call those methods, but the backend adapter is responsible for persistence,
isolation, provenance, and conflict handling.
