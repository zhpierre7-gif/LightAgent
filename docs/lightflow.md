## LightFlow

LightAgent v0.8.0 introduces `LightFlow`, a lightweight deterministic workflow
runner for chaining multiple `LightAgent` instances into explicit steps.

`LightFlow` is intentionally small: it provides DAG-style dependencies, step
input/output passing, step retries, structured results, and flow-level trace
events without adding a heavy orchestration dependency.

### Basic Usage

```python
from LightAgent import LightAgent, LightFlow

research_agent = LightAgent(
    name="ResearchAgent",
    model="gpt-4.1",
    api_key="your_api_key",
    base_url="your_base_url",
)

writer_agent = LightAgent(
    name="WriterAgent",
    model="gpt-4.1",
    api_key="your_api_key",
    base_url="your_base_url",
)

flow = (
    LightFlow()
    .step("research", agent=research_agent)
    .step("write", agent=writer_agent, depends_on=["research"])
)

result = flow.run("Analyze this company", trace=True)

print(result.content)
print(result.success)
print(result.trace)
```

When a step depends on previous steps and does not define a custom query,
LightFlow appends the dependency outputs to the original input.

### Custom Step Input

Use a callable `query` when a step needs precise control over its prompt.

```python
flow = (
    LightFlow()
    .step("research", agent=research_agent)
    .step(
        "write",
        agent=writer_agent,
        depends_on=["research"],
        query=lambda context: f"Write a concise report from: {context['outputs']['research']}",
    )
)
```

The callable receives a context dictionary:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `input` | The original flow input. |
| `outputs` | Mapping of completed step name to string output. |
| `steps` | Mapping of completed step name to `LightFlowStepResult`. |

### Step Retries

Each step can retry when the underlying agent returns a structured error.

```python
flow.step("research", agent=research_agent, max_retry=2)
```

Retries are step-local. If a step still fails after its retries, the flow stops
and returns a `LightFlowResult` with `success == False`.

### Result Formats

The default result is a `LightFlowResult` object:

```python
result = flow.run("Analyze this company")
print(result.content)
print(result.steps[0].content)
print(result.error)
```

You can also request a string or dictionary:

```python
text = flow.run("Analyze this company", result_format="str")
data = flow.run("Analyze this company", result_format="dict")
```

### Trace Events

Pass `trace=True` to collect flow-level events:

| Event | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `flow_start` | The flow started. |
| `step_start` | A step started. |
| `step_end` | A step completed or failed. |
| `flow_end` | The flow completed or stopped on failure. |

Each step also preserves the underlying agent trace when the agent returns a
structured `RunResult`.

### Current Scope

The initial v0.8.0 implementation is focused on non-streaming deterministic
workflows. Durable execution, manual approval nodes, and resume support are
planned as later roadmap items.
